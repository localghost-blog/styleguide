As [Google Style Guides](https://google.github.io/styleguide/) says,
> Every major open-source project has its own style guide: a set of conventions (sometimes arbitrary) about how to write code for that project. It is much easier to understand a large codebase when all the code in it is in a consistent style.
>
> “Style” covers a lot of ground, from “use camelCase for variable names” to “never use global variables” to “never use exceptions.”

This project [localghost-blog/styleguide](https://github.com/localghost-blog/styleguide) links to the style guidelines I use for my other projects.

This project holds the [$\LaTeX$ Style Guide](/styleguide/latex-style-guide).
